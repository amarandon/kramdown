## kramdown 0.9.0 released

The biggest change in this release is the addition of a kramdown converter. This converter together
with the HTML parser can be used to convert an HTML document into a kramdown document.

## Changes

* Major changes:

  - New *kramdown converter* that converts an element tree into a kramdown document

* Minor changes:

  - Added option `numeric_entities` that defines whether entities are output using their names or
    their numeric values
  - Ruby 1.9 only: The HTML converter now always tries to convert entities to their character
    equivalences if possible
  - Change in HTML parser: conversion of `pre` and `code` elements to their native counterpart is
    only done if they contain no entities (under Ruby 1.9 entities are converted to characters
    before this check if possible)
  - The comment extension now produces comment elements that are used by the converters
  - IALs can now also be assigned to definitions (i.e. `dd` elements)

* Bug fixes:

  - Fixed problem with list item IALs: the IAL was not recognized when first element was a code
    block

* Deprecation notes:

  - The `filter_html` option has been removed.
  - The method `Kramdown::Converter::Html#options_for_element` has been renamed to
    `html_attributes`, using the old name is deprecated and the alias will be removed in the next
    release
